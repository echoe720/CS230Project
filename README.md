# CS230Project
Milestone.zip contains all code used to parse the Gutenberg dataset into our final dataset, as well as the notebook for our baseline model.
The notebook CountVectorizer Baseline.ipynb file loads the Gutenberg dataset, and then runs our baseline model on it. 
There is commented out code that would change the baseline to use manual features instead.
The other file contains our preliminary attempts at implementing a GRU/LSTM method.
